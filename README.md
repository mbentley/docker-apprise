# mbentley/apprise

This docker image is based off of the [`caronc/apprise`](https://hub.docker.com/r/caronc/apprise) image on Docker Hub for [`caronc/apprise`](https://github.com/caronc/apprise).

## Why

Many imageis on Docker Hub are not always updated as regularly as I would like. They can ship vulnerable libraries/binaries so in order to combat that, I am maintaining some of own rebased images in the form of Dockerfiles that can patch those vulnerabilities. There are no customizations outside of patching and rebasing the images.
