# mbentley/apprise

This docker image is based off of the [`caronc/apprise`](https://hub.docker.com/r/caronc/apprise) image on Docker Hub for [`apprise`](https://github.com/caronc/apprise).

## Why

The image on Docker Hub is not always updated as regularly as I would like.  They can ship vulnerable libraries/binaries so in order to combat that, I am maintaining my own rebased images.  There are no customizations outside of patching and rebasing the images.
